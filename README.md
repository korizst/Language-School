# Language-School
I have created this small application to practise SQL basics. This programm manages the members of a language school. The members can be either admin or teacher or student. The admin members are permitted to make changes. They can view all of the data of all members.
The teachers can list their own students or every students of the school. The students can see only their own data. I have created a login function, so every member can log in to the program, so the application can detect, what kind of permissions the user has.
